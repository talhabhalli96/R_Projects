##Statement Of Purpose
We have to answer the following question.
*How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*
To answer that question we will look at data from last 12 months and explore connections between variables and provide a detailed analysis of dataset and also recommendation aimed at helping in advertisement campaign.


### Downloading and Storing Data
* Data can be downloaded using following link.
<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>

* Data is organized in monthly datasets, so we need to download data from last 12 months.
Note: Data is from March 2022 to February 2023

* Data is unbiased and credible and it does ROCCC.
Reliable          Yes
Original          Yes
Comprehensive     Yes
Current           Yes
Cited             Yes

* Data in all datasets is organized in same format (all datasets contain same 13 columns with same names)



### Loading Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```


### Loading Datasets
Note: We have montly datasets from cyclistic company, so first we need to load them and then merge them.

```{r echo=TRUE}
march_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
april_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
june_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
july_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
August_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv")
oct_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_2022 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_2023 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_2023 <- read_csv("D:/da/google/project/case study 1/202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

### Merging Datasets
Note: We will use rbind function for merging datasets.

```{r}
cyclist_merged <- rbind(march_2022,april_2022,may_2022,june_2022,july_2022,August_2022,sep_2022,oct_2022,nov_2022,dec_2022,jan_2023,feb_2023)
```

### Viewing Data
* Structure of Dataset
```{r}
str(cyclist_merged)
```

* Viewing First 6 Rows
```{r}
head(cyclist_merged)
```
## Cleaning Data

### Checking & Removing Nulls
* Checking Nulls
```{r}
sum(is.na(cyclist_merged))
```

* As Dataset contains null values, we will now *remove* them.
```{r}
cyclist_merged <- na.omit(cyclist_merged)
```

### Checking and Removing Duplicates
* Checking Duplicates
```{r}
sum(duplicated(cyclist_merged$ride_id))
```

Note: As dataset does not contain any Duplicates, we do not need to remove them.

### Adding some extra variables
Note: We need to add some extra varaibles for  better analysis of dataset

#### Trip Duration Variable
* First we create ride_length variable, we fill format that data in mins
```{r}
ride_length <- difftime(cyclist_merged$ended_at, cyclist_merged$started_at, units = 'mins')
```

* Now we add this variable in dataset
```{r}
cyclist_merged <- mutate(cyclist_merged, trip_duration = ride_length)
```

*Note: Same steps will be followed for other variables*

#### Start Ride Hour
```{r}
started_at_hour <- hour(cyclist_merged$started_at)
cyclist_merged <- mutate(cyclist_merged, ride_hour = started_at_hour)
```

#### Day Of Ride
```{r}
started_at_day <- wday(cyclist_merged$started_at, TRUE)
cyclist_merged <- mutate(cyclist_merged, ride_day = started_at_day)
```

#### Month of Ride
```{r}
Start_at_month <- months.Date(cyclist_merged$started_at)
cyclist_merged <- mutate(cyclist_merged, ride_month = Start_at_month)
```


### Changing Name of Dataset
Note: We will change the name to cyclistic_clean_data for accessbility purposes
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data <- cyclist_merged
```

* Checking data
```{r}
head(cyclistic_clean_data)
```


*Now data is clean and we can move to analysis phase*

### Quick statistics
*Checking Summary*
```{r}
summary(cyclistic_clean_data)
```

## Analysis


### Compare Member vs Casuals

```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent =n*100/sum(n))
```


```{r}
ggplot(cyclistic_clean_data) + geom_bar(aes(x=member_casual, fill=member_casual)) + labs(title = 'Member Vs Casuals', x= "Type of Users", y= "Number of Users")
```

*As we can see that over 60% rides were taken by members, while others were casuals.


### Ride Duration Analysis
```{r}
cat('Average duration of Ride is:', mean(cyclistic_clean_data$trip_duration), "mins")

```
```{r}
cat('Maximun duration of Ride is:',round(max(cyclistic_clean_data$trip_duration)/60/24), "days")
```

#### Ride Duration Comparison
```{r}
bar <- cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(avg_ride_duration = mean(trip_duration))
bar
```
```{r}
ggplot(bar) + geom_col(aes(x=member_casual, y= avg_ride_duration, fill = member_casual)) + labs(title = 'Average Ride duration', subtitle = 'Member vs Casual', x='User Type', y='Avg Ride Duration') + scale_fill_manual(values = c('green','pink'))
```
*Average trip duration is around 16 mins.
*By conducting further analysis we come to know that members in average take smaller trips(12mins) while casual customers take longer trips(23.5mins).


### Number Of Rides by Month
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(ride_month) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent = n*100/sum(n)) %>% arrange(ride_month)
```

Note: Months are not in chronological order.
*Rides in winter decrease to its lowest levels and rise is seen with arrival of spring and summer sees peak userage.


### Number Of Rides by Weekday
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(ride_day) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent = n*100/sum(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(cyclistic_clean_data) + geom_bar(aes(x=ride_day, fill= ride_day)) + labs(title = 'Number of Rides Per Weekday', x='Weekday', y='Number Of Rides')
```

*Rides remain steady through out week, an increase is observed on Saturday(due to weekend).

#### Comparing Members And Casuals With Respect to Weekday rides

##### Members
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(ride_day) %>%  filter(member_casual=='member') %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent = n*100/sum(n))
```

##### Casuals
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(ride_day) %>%  filter(member_casual=='casual') %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent = n*100/sum(n))
```

##### Plot
```{r}
ggplot(cyclistic_clean_data) + geom_bar(aes(x=ride_day, fill= ride_day)) + labs(title = 'Number of Rides Per Weekday',subtitle = 'Member vs Casual', x='Weekday', y='Number Of Rides') + facet_wrap(~member_casual)
```

*Members take most of the rides on office days, usage is down on weekend.
*Casual customers usage is spiked on weekends and on office days it remain steady.


#### Type of Bikes
```{r}
cyclistic_clean_data %>% group_by(rideable_type) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(percent =n*100/sum(n))
```
```{r}
ggplot(cyclistic_clean_data) + geom_bar(aes(x=rideable_type, fill = rideable_type)) + labs(title = 'Types of Bikes Share in Trips', x='Type Of Bike', y= "Number of Trips")
```

*Majority of customers prefer classic bikes, electric bikes come second, while docked bike constitutes around 3% share.

##### Ride type (Member vs Casual)
```{r}
ggplot(cyclistic_clean_data) + geom_bar(aes(x=rideable_type, fill = rideable_type)) + labs(title = 'Types of Bikes Share in Trips',subtitle = 'Casual Vs Member', x='Type Of Bike', y= "Number of Trips") + facet_wrap(~member_casual)
```

*Trends are almost same in respective categories of customers while market share do change. Docked bikes are not used by members at all.


*For Further Analysis and visualization we will continue in Tableau*

#### Montly Ridership And Avg Trip Duration

![Data from march 2022 to feb 2023](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 214003.png)

* As discussed above ridership is at peak in summer and decreases in winter

#### Weekday data

![Above Data Split by Customer type and in weekday](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 215021.png)

* It can be clearly seem Average trip duration of casual riders is more than members.
* Casual riders usually tend to travel on weekends especially saturday while members mostly travel on workdays which means that they are formal workers.

#### Daily Ridership and TripDuration Data

![Ridership and Trip duration Data with Respect to Hours](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 215715.png)

* Most of the casual riders ride after noon until night.


### Stations Data (Top 10)

#### Start Station & End station

![start station data](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 220218.png)

![end station Data](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 220533.png)

* Top Start and End stations are almost same.

#### Start Station and End Station By Customer type

![Start Station- Member&Casual](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 221059.png)

![End Station- Member&Casual](C:\Users\tsale\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-03-18 221259.png)

*  Streeter Dr & Grand Avenue is mos popular station due to large number of casual users starting and ending rides at this station


### Recommendations

1- Provide bikes to casual users on Weekend on a premium and offer membership at a discounted price.

2- Begin advertisement campaign on top 5 popular stations for casuals on weekend especially Saturday.

3- Begin this campaign at start of summer when user base is large.
